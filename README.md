# LT-Club
Code that used to create the learning platform of LT club using React and Node.
I have developed a learning platform that can perform as a dual end application where admins end have access to easily upload any sort of content and on the otherhand the learners can have the all learning Interface.
It is likely a clone to GeeksForGeeks or w3schools on the learners end.
